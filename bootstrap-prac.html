            <p class="card-text font-weight-bold">A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. We can fix anything.

                So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. Only eight colors that you need. We don't have anything but happy trees here. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things.

                Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. This piece of canvas is your world.

                I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Here we're limited by the time we have. In your world you have total and absolute power. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner.

                We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. See there how easy that is. Here's something that's fun.

                How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. There we go. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. There it is.

                If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy.
